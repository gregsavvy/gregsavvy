### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### I love coding and Iâ€™m constantly trying to improve the reach of my tech skills in general and my knowledge of Go in particular. Why Go? I think it's because I believe brevity, clarity and efficiency in coding structure of any project is very important and Go is designed with such qualities in mind. 

### Please, feel free to look through my repos below.
