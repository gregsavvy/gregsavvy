### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

### I love coding and managing projects. Iâ€™m constantly trying to improve the reach of my tech skills in general and my knowledge of Go in particular. Why Go? I adore brevity, clarity and efficiency of syntax and coding structure that Go allows to pursue and get the product/project done.

### Please, feel free to look through my repos below.

### - Currently working at Samsung SDS on internal web applications for business departments. ðŸ”­
### - Also currently learning C++. ðŸŒ±
